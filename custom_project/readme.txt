I really enjoyed this project and wish I had more time to devote to it as I never got around to implementing 
things like menus and an audio system.

I am quite proud of the core systems I created however and I think my gameobject, movement, and collission systems could
be be the foundation of far more than just this game. I got quite caught up in creating that framework that in the end
my game ended up being more of a tech demo of those systems. Oh well!


Project files and a 3 minute video showing off the code and discussing the major challenges I faced are included.


See the 'Controls.pdf' for brief instructions on how to play the game.
